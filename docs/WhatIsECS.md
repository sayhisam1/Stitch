# What is Stitch?
**Stitch** is a simple and powerful [Entity Component System (ECS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) built specifically for Roblox game development. 

Stitch allows you to separate the **data** and **behavior** of things in your game. This means your code will be easier to understand and update, and more performant.
